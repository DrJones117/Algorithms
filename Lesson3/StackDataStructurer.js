// First off, a Stack is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure. Like a stack of plates or a stack of pancakes.
// You can't rermove the bottom of a stack of pancakes without toppling the whole thing. 
// You must remove the top one first which, consequently, was the last one you put in. Last in, First out.

// We use push() to add to the top and pop() to remove from the top.

class Main{
    
    constructor()
    {
        this.items = [];
    }


    // Stacks have five unique methods
    // push(new item)
    // pop()
    // peek()
    // isEmpty()
    // printStack()
