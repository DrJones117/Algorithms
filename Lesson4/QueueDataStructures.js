// A Queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure. 
// It is a Linear Data Structure. It is designed to hold elements prior to proccessing.

// A Queue has a Head and a Tail, and because it is a FIFO data struture, 
// the head will be removed first and the item in the Queue will become the new head. This is called dequeuing.
// Enqueuing adds an item to the back of the Queue and that new item becomes the new tail.
