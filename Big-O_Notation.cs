// Big-O notion is essentially how efficient is an algorithm over time.

// The big ones to keep in mind are O(n^2), O(n), and O(1). There are others, but these are the most common.

// O(1) - "Constant" is the best an algorithm can possibly be. This is an algorithm that has one operation.

// O(n) - "Linear" is slightly worse but still good. The bigger the data you put in, the bigger the time complexity.
// An algorithm that uses a for loop.

// O(n^2) - "Quadratic" or "Brute Force" is usually pretty bad and you want to avoid it. Nested for loops.
