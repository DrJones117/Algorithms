Here are the concepts we will cover in this course...

1. Basic Data Structures
2. Big O Notation
3. String manipulation
4. Searching Algorithms
5. Sorting Algorithms
6. Graphs
7. Trees 
8. Linked Lists

The reasons to learn Data Structures and Algorithms are that you will have to solve an 
algorithm in a technical coding interview and you will learn how to be an efficient.
